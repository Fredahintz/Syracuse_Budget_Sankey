Sankey diagrams are a helpful way to visualize budget data. 

As a citizen of the city of Syracuse I thought it would be interesting to see where my tax dollars are going with one of these cool diagrams. 

Tasks: 
 - [x] Retrieve data from datacuse
 - [x] Read it into pandas
 - [x] Convert to Sankey node structure
 - [x] Visualize in plotly and make edits based on visualization
 - [x] Hit the datacuse API rather than download the csv file. 
 - [ ] Generalize and compare to previous budgets
 - [ ] Highlight Interesting Insights. 
 - [ ] Is it possible to animate them? 



What are the interesting insights? 

 - Police and Fire Departments are the largest expenditure by far.
 - Most of the revenue comes from non-property tax or state aid, though a substantial amount comes from a variety of sources.
